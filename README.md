# Standle

Stand up!

## Setting Up

1. Install [Tauri Prerequisites](https://tauri.studio/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites)
2. Clone and install dependencies (this template uses `pnpm` by default):

```sh
pnpm i
```

## Usage

A Tauri app has at least [two processes](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/architecture/process-model):

- the Core Process (`backend`, or _main_ process in Electron terminology), and
- the WebView process (`frontend`, or _renderer_ in Electron)

### ðŸ¦¢ Frontend (TS, PnPM)

#### Running Development Server

Both back- and frontend start with a single command:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

#### Building

```sh
pnpm build
```
